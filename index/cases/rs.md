# Rosen-Suzuki
From: Miguel Munoz Zuniga & Delphine Sinoquet (2020) Global optimization for mixed categorical-continuous variables based on Gaussian process models with a randomized categorical space exploration step, INFOR: Information Systems and Operational Research, 58:2, 310-341, DOI: 10.1080/03155986.2020.1730677

The modification made by Zuniga and Sinoquet is to considerate a categorical variable which select between f<sub>i</sub> function. 

We made the assumption that the continuous variables are between [-5,5] because the original problem was left unbounded.
